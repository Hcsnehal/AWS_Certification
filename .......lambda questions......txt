.......lambda questions.....

1)Which of the following services are not supported by AWS Lambda? (choose 1)

EC2
S3
Alexa
CloudFront
RedShift

ans:EC2
explanation:To a certain extent, lambda and EC2 are competing technologies. While lambda aims to remove or drastically reduce the amount of configuration needed to run your software, EC2 exposes the developer to the virtual machine that ultimately runs their code. In addition lambda scales effortlessly while EC2 requires more complex configuration to achieve the same result.

2)You are using lambda (with large ram allocations) to process videos uploaded to S3 and to convert from their video format to H264. However the operation fails when dealing with particularly large video files. What is the cause of this?

The default 5 minute time out
Lambda does not allow video encoding
S3 transfer bottlenecks
S3 cannot talk to Lambda

ans:A

3)Of the following, which are handled by Lambda by default? (choose 2)
Please select 2 correct answers

Automatic scaling
Security patches
The lambda functions code
Triggers that activate the function

ans:A,B

4)As lambda executes functions in the cloud and not traditionally on a VM. You are limited as to what code you can run within lambda. Is this statement true?

True
False
ans:B
Lambda does not enforce any restrictions on your function logic â€“ if you can code for it, you can run it within a Lambda function. As part of your function, you may need to call other APIs, or access other AWS services like databases.

Ans:D
AWS Lambda pricing is based on the number of function invocations, memory allocation, and execution duration. The search results mention that you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time your code executes. Additionally, the duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 1ms, and the price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function.


56)What is the purpose of the AWS Lambda DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)?

A) To handle failed function invocations
B) To store function logs
C) To manage function dependencies
D) To store function environment variables
Ans:A
According to the search results, a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is used to capture and store unprocessed events from asynchronous invocations for further analysis or reprocessing. When a Lambda function execution fails, AWS Lambda can retry the execution. However, if the retry attempts fail, Lambda discards the event. To avoid this, a DLQ can be configured to capture the event and its payload for later analysis or reprocessing. This helps to prevent event loss, improve visibility into failures, and reduce the need for manual intervention in such scenarios.
